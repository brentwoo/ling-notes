macro:->\textit
{Quote}
itself
has
a
basket
of
interesting
properties.
To
mention
a
few:
it
can
interrupt
very
small
units,
like
breaking
up
an
ADJ
from
its
N
as
demonstrated
in
(\ref
{quote1});
its
meaning
of
derision
in
(\ref
{quote1});
its
meaning
of
verbatim
but
not
necessarily
spoken
in
(\ref
{quote2}).
\textit
{Quote}
might
be
the
only
kind
of
correlative
spoken
punctuation,
with
the
possible
correlate
\textit
{unquote}
used
to
help
delimit
the
scope.
Standard,
intuitive
usage
simply
flanks
the
material.
\begin

There
also
exists
a
kind
of
Polish
notation
variant
where
the
entire
``quote-unquote''
is
uttered
before
the
quotation,
which
is
also
not
uncommon.
\begin
{exe}

\end
{exe}
There
is
no
such
variant
for
other
correlatives
constructions:
\textit
{*either
or
John
Mary,
*both
and
Tim
Minh}.
Note
also
\textit
{quote}
can
stand
on
its
own,
while
\textit
{unquote}
cannot.
